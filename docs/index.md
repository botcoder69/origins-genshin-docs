# Welcome to the Origins: Genshin Documentation

Tired of your standard Hud Render cooldowns? Wish you could have a cooler and nicer way to see your origin power cooldowns? Well, look no further.

Origins: Genshin is a Origin addon developed for Fabric. It adds Genshin-styled rendering for your Origin powers.

This documentation should contain all the information you need for using the Origins: Genshin mod.

# General information
- Data for rendering Elemental Skills and Elemental Bursts is **additive**, meaning that removing **Origins: Genshin** or using a datapack that uses the mod should **not** cause any errors or conflicts! 
- This mod is required on both the Client and Server due to how Calio (Origins' serialization library) handles data. Therefore, the mod needs to be on the server-side to add the data necessary for rendering Elemental Skills and Bursts. If this mod is not on the server, then you can't have your Elemental Skills or Bursts rendered, even if you have the mod on the client!
